RecipeBank is a Node.js/Express/Pug/MongoDB/SASS application with support for multi-user accounts. Users are allowed to search, browse and view all recipes, and to create, update and delete their own recipes. The choice of database management system is MongoDB, which is a document-oriented database and was selected for its flexibility. Some routes of the app are public, including home/index, login, register, registered and api, while others require authentication, including loggedin, logout, search, addrecipe, recipeadded, updaterecipe/*, recipeupdated/*, deleterecipe/*, recipedeleted/*, search, search-results, list, myrecipes and recipes/*. The wild card routes either set/create or require a nonce when accessed. To update a recipe, a user first has to be logged in to access the updaterecipe/* route (lines 300-357, main.js). To accesses the updaterecipe/* route, where * is a recipe slug, the user must be the author of the recipe with slug *. The route creates a nonce and presents an update recipe form, similar to the one of the addrecipe route, but previous values are entered and editable. Once changes are published, the user a directed to the /recipeupdated/* route and the nonce created by te updaterecipe/* route is verified.
